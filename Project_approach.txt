How I intend to approach this project:

1. make a data cleaning notebook clean outliers and have the dataset null values filled.

2. Do some EDA in another note book and produce a few seperate dataframes with some visualizations

3. Have my final regression notebook with the cleaned data and features i want to use to run my model.
