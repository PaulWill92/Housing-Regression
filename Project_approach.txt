How I intend to approach this project:

1. make a data cleaning notebook clean outliers and have the dataset null
values filled. - I dropped outliers 4 standard deviations from the mean. I
handled a few extreme values by taking the average of houses that match the
dimension's of the extremes.

2. Do some EDA in another note book and produce a few seperate dataframes with
some visualizations took advantage of pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for my
exploratory data analysis

3. Have my final regression notebook with the cleaned data and features i want to use to run my model.
Linear regression model can be improved using some more features and doing some
feature engineering.
